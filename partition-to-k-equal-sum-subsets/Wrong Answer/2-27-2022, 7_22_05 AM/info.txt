Taken become decimal of 01010.\n// Now when we check for subset containing 1st,2nd and 4th element i.e m=11010 (assume). Then AND of mask 'm' and taken is !=0, hence we dont consider this subset.\n\n// NOTE: we need to sort the nums array in decreasing order, as bitmasking checks from right to left, and we need to make subsets of smaller elements as possible(no concreate proof why so)\n\n// Time Complexity : O((2^n) * n).\n\n","compare_result":"111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111101010011100","title_slug":"partition-to-k-equal-sum-subsets"}
